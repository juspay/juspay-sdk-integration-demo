### How do I get set up? ###

* This repo is used to show the code section of the documentation.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* If you want to add any new product and/or platform. please follow the below steps.

1. All the code content of a particular platform of a product is kept in a branch "productName" + "-" + "platformName".
    Let suppose you are adding code for platform android in the product payment-page then the name of the branch will be 
        payment-page-android

2. And payment-page-android code have both Java and Kotlin so there will be two folders named accordingly and each folder should contain their demo code.
